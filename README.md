# Exit-Program-Loop
This script is a simple program that prompts the user to type a response and then prints the response back to the user. The script will continue to prompt the user for a response until the user types 'exit', at which point the script will exit.

# Requirements
This script requires Python3 to be installed on the system.

# Usage
To run the script, open a command line terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, enter the command ‘python3 script.py.

The script will start running and will repeatedly prompt the user to type a response. The user can type any response, and the script will print the response back to the user. To exit the script, the user must type 'exit' (without quotes) and press enter.

# Limitations
This script is a basic example and doesn't include any error handling or validation. It is intended to be used as a starting point for more complex programs.

# Conclusion
This script is a simple program that demonstrates the basic functionality of user input and output in Python. It can be used as a starting point for more complex programs that require user input and output. The script uses a while loop that continues running until the user types "exit", and then it uses ‘sys.exit()’ to exit the script. As always, it is important to consider the legal and ethical implications of any code you write and run.
